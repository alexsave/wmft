# Part III — Long-Term Success

# Chapter 5 — Staying Healthy

You've learned to run consistently and gotten faster. Now comes the hardest part: doing it for years without getting injured. This chapter covers the unglamorous but crucial aspects of long-term running health.

## The Injury Prevention Hierarchy

**Level 1: Load Management (Most Important)**
- Follow the 10% rule for mileage increases
- Include easy days between hard sessions
- Take planned recovery weeks every 4th week
- Listen to your body's warning signs

**Level 2: Movement Quality**  
- Maintain basic mobility in hips, ankles, and thoracic spine
- Address obvious movement compensations
- Include some strength training (even 15 minutes 2×/week helps)

**Level 3: Recovery Practices**
- Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep nightly
- Manage life stress (it affects training stress)
- Consider massage, stretching, or other recovery modalities

::: note
**Coach's Note**  
Most runners focus on Level 3 (foam rolling, ice baths) while ignoring Level 1 (smart training). Get the hierarchy right.

## Warning Signs to Heed

### Red Flags (Stop Running)
- Sharp, sudden pain during a run
- Pain that gets worse as you run
- Pain that affects your running gait
- Any pain that keeps you awake at night

### Yellow Flags (Proceed with Caution)  
- Mild soreness that improves with warmup
- General fatigue lasting more than 2-3 days
- Elevated resting heart rate for multiple days
- Mood changes or loss of motivation

## The Minimal Effective Dose

You don't need hours of injury prevention work. Here's what actually moves the needle:

### Daily (5 minutes)
- **Hip circles:** 10 forward, 10 backward each leg
- **Leg swings:** 10 front-to-back, 10 side-to-side each leg  
- **Calf raises:** 20 slow and controlled
- **Single-leg balance:** 30 seconds each leg

### 2×/Week (15 minutes)
**Strength Circuit:**
1. **Squats:** 2 × 12-15 bodyweight
2. **Single-leg deadlifts:** 2 × 8 each leg
3. **Planks:** 2 × 30-60 seconds
4. **Clamshells:** 2 × 15 each side
5. **Calf raises:** 2 × 20

### Weekly (20 minutes)
**Mobility Flow:**
- **Pigeon pose:** 2 minutes each side
- **Couch stretch:** 2 minutes each leg
- **Thoracic spine rotations:** 10 each direction
- **Ankle circles:** 10 each direction, each foot

::: tip
**Pro Tip:** Stack these routines with existing habits. Do mobility while watching TV, strength after easy runs, daily movement before coffee.

## Sleep: The Ultimate Performance Enhancer

Poor sleep undermines everything else you do. Running on insufficient sleep is like training with a weighted vest—you're making everything harder for no benefit.

### Sleep Hygiene for Runners

**Evening (2-3 hours before bed):**
- Dim the lights and avoid screens
- Keep bedroom temperature cool (65-68°F)
- Consider a warm bath or shower
- Light stretching or reading

**Morning:**
- Get sunlight within 30 minutes of waking
- Consistent wake time, even on weekends
- Avoid snoozing (disrupts sleep cycles)

### Recovery Tracking

You don't need fancy devices, but pay attention to:
- **Resting heart rate:** 5+ bpm elevation = potential overreaching
- **Sleep quality:** Restless nights often precede injury or illness
- **Mood and motivation:** Persistent low mood = time to back off
- **Workout performance:** Can't hit normal paces = need more recovery

The goal isn't perfect health—it's sustainable progress over years and decades.
