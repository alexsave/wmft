# Chapter 2 — Building Your Base

Now that you've survived your first week, it's time to build aerobic fitness. This is where the magic happens—but it happens slowly and quietly.

## The 80/20 Rule

**80% of your running should feel easy.** Only 20% should be hard work (intervals, tempo runs, races). This isn't just advice for beginners—elite marathoners follow the same principle.

### What "Easy" Means

- You can speak in full sentences
- Your breathing feels controlled  
- You could maintain this pace for hours (even if you don't want to)
- Heart rate stays in Zone 1-2 (if you use a monitor)

::: note
**Coach's Note**  
Most new runners make their easy days too hard and their hard days too easy. Don't be most runners.

## Monthly Progression

**Weeks 2-5: Base Building**

| Week | Easy Runs | One Workout | Long Run |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 2 | 3 × 25-35 min | 6 × 200m | 45-55 min |
| 3 | 3 × 30-40 min | 4 × 400m | 50-60 min |
| 4 | 3 × 35-45 min | 20 min tempo | 55-65 min |
| 5 | 3 × 30-35 min | 6 × 200m | 45-50 min |

**Week 5 is a recovery week**—don't skip it! Your body adapts during rest, not during the workout itself.

## Form Fundamentals

Good running form is efficient running form. Focus on these basics:

### Cadence
- Aim for 170-180 steps per minute
- Use a metronome app or find music at the right BPM
- Quick, light steps reduce impact

### Posture  
- Run tall with a slight forward lean from your ankles
- Keep shoulders relaxed and arms at 90 degrees
- Look ahead, not down at your feet

### Breathing
- Breathe from your belly, not your chest
- Try rhythmic breathing: 3 steps in, 2 steps out
- Don't overthink it—your body knows what to do

::: tip
**Pro Tip:** Film yourself running from the side. Most form issues become obvious when you can see them.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Doing too much, too soon** → Follow the 10% rule: increase weekly mileage by no more than 10%
2. **Running the same pace every day** → Easy should feel easy, hard should feel hard  
3. **Ignoring rest days** → Your body gets stronger during recovery, not during the run
4. **Comparing yourself to others** → Your only competition is yesterday's version of yourself
