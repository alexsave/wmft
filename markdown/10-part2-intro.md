# Part II - Getting Faster 

## Speed Fundamentals  

You've built a solid base of easy running. Now it's time to add some spice to your training with structured workouts that will make you faster.

### The Two Keystone Workouts

Every runner needs just two types of hard workouts. Master these and you'll improve dramatically:

#### Workout 1: Tempo Lite
- **15–20 minutes continuous** @ "comfortably hard" effort (RPE 7/10)
- This is the pace you could hold for about an hour in a race
- Builds lactate threshold and mental toughness

#### Workout 2: Speed Sprinkle  
- **8 × 200m fast** with full recovery (walk/jog 200m between)
- This improves running economy and neuromuscular power
- Should feel like 85-90% effort, not all-out sprints

**Coach's Note**  
These aren't the only workouts that work, but they're the most bang for your buck. Master these before getting fancy.

### Workout Integration

**Weekly Pattern:**
- **Monday:** Easy run (30-45 min)
- **Tuesday:** Speed Sprinkle + easy cooldown  
- **Wednesday:** Easy run (30-45 min)
- **Thursday:** Tempo Lite + easy cooldown
- **Friday:** Easy run or rest
- **Saturday:** Easy run (30-40 min)  
- **Sunday:** Long run (60-90 min easy)

#### Progression Over 8 Weeks

**Weeks 1-2:** Learn the efforts, focus on form
**Weeks 3-4:** Add volume (10 × 200m, 25 min tempo)  
**Weeks 5-6:** Add intensity (faster 200s, harder tempo)
**Weeks 7-8:** Peak and recover

### Pacing Guidelines

#### For Tempo Runs:
- Start conservatively-you should think "I could go faster"
- By halfway, it should feel "comfortably hard"  
- Final quarter should require focus to maintain pace
- Cool down with 10-15 minutes easy

#### For Speed Work:
- First few reps should feel controlled
- Middle reps are where you find your rhythm
- Final reps require mental toughness
- Walk or jog slowly between intervals

::: tip
**Pro Tip:** Use a GPS watch or track for speed work, but learn to run tempo by feel. Racing is about effort, not splits.

### The Science Behind Speed

**Tempo runs** improve your lactate threshold-the fastest pace you can run while clearing lactate as fast as you produce it. This directly translates to faster race times.

**Short intervals** improve:
- Running economy (how efficiently you use oxygen)
- Neuromuscular power (how forcefully you can push off)
- Confidence in faster paces

Together, these workouts address the two main limiters of distance running performance: your aerobic engine and your mechanical efficiency.
