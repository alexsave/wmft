# Part I — Start Fast

# Chapter 1 — Your First 7 Days

Welcome to running! The first week is crucial—not for building fitness (that takes months), but for building the habit. This chapter will get you moving safely and confidently.

## The 10-Minute Rule

If you feel flat before a run, start anyway and reassess after 10 minutes. If you still feel terrible, jog home and live to train another day. Most of the time, you'll feel better and continue.

**Coach's Note**  
Easy days should feel *easy*. If you can't hold a conversation while running, you're going too fast. Back off the pace.

## Daily Checklist (Week 1)

Every run this week should follow this structure:

- **5–15 minutes easy warm-up** (walking → light jogging)
- **Main run @ RPE 4–6** (conversational pace)
- **4 × 20-second strides** (walk back recovery)
- **5 minutes easy cool-down** (light jog → walking)

### Weekly Schedule

| Day | Run | Notes |
|-----|-----|-------|
| Mon | 20–30 min easy | Keep heart rate low |
| Tue | Rest or walk | Active recovery |
| Wed | 8 × 200m fast | Walk/jog 200m between |
| Thu | Rest or walk | Complete rest is fine |
| Fri | 25–35 min easy | Focus on form |
| Sat | Rest | Prepare for Sunday |
| Sun | 40–50 min easy | Optional gentle hills |

::: tip
**Pro Tip:** Schedule your next day's run during today's cool-down. Habit stacking beats motivation every time.

## What to Expect

**Week 1 Goals:**
- Complete 3–4 runs without injury
- Establish a consistent time of day
- Learn what "easy pace" feels like
- Build confidence in your ability to run

Don't worry about speed, distance, or comparing yourself to others. The only goal is showing up consistently.
