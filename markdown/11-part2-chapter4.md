# Chapter 4 — Race Preparation

You've been training consistently for months. Now it's time to put that fitness to the test. Whether it's a 5K or marathon, the principles of race prep remain the same.

## Choosing Your First Race

**Good First Race Characteristics:**
- Local (within 30 minutes of home)
- Well-organized (check reviews online)  
- Flat or gently rolling course
- Mid-morning start time (8-10 AM)
- 500+ participants (good energy, not overwhelming)

### Distance Recommendations

| Current Weekly Mileage | Suggested Race Distance |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 15-25 miles/week | 5K |
| 25-35 miles/week | 10K |
| 35-50 miles/week | Half Marathon |
| 50+ miles/week | Marathon |

::: note
**Coach's Note**  
Your first race should feel challenging but achievable. Save the stretch goals for race #2.

## The 3-Week Taper

**Week -3 (Hard Week):**
- Maintain normal training load
- Include race-pace segments in workouts
- Practice race-day nutrition

**Week -2 (Reduce Volume):**

- Keep intensity but reduce volume of workouts
- Do a short race-pace shakeout

**Week -1 (Race Week):**
- Cut mileage by 50%
- Easy runs only, plus one short race-pace segment
- Focus on sleep, nutrition, logistics

## Race Week Checklist

### 3 Days Before:
- [ ] Pick up race packet (if required)
- [ ] Study the course map
- [ ] Plan your transportation and parking
- [ ] Lay out all race gear

### 1 Day Before:
- [ ] Easy 20-30 minute run with 4 × 20-second strides
- [ ] Carb-load dinner (nothing new!)
- [ ] Set out everything for race morning
- [ ] Early bedtime (8-9 PM)

### Race Morning:
- [ ] Wake up 3 hours before race start
- [ ] Familiar breakfast 2-3 hours before
- [ ] Arrive at venue 60-90 minutes early
- [ ] Easy 10-15 minute warmup + strides

## Pacing Strategy

### The Even Split Method (Recommended)
Run the first half slightly slower than goal pace, second half at or slightly faster than goal pace.

**Example for 25:00 5K goal:**
- Mile 1: 8:05 (5 seconds slower than 8:00 pace)
- Mile 2: 8:00 (goal pace)  
- Mile 3.1: 7:55 (5 seconds faster than goal pace)

::: tip
**Pro Tip:** Start in the corral that matches your goal time, not your best workout time. It's easier to pass people than get passed.

## Mental Strategies

### Pre-Race Nerves
Nervousness is normal and actually helpful—it means your body is preparing for performance. Channel that energy:

- **Reframe anxiety as excitement:** "I'm excited" vs "I'm nervous"
- **Focus on process, not outcome:** Think about form and pacing, not finish times
- **Use positive self-talk:** "I'm prepared" instead of "I hope I don't blow up"

### During the Race

**First Third:** Stay relaxed, resist the urge to go with early surges
**Middle Third:** Settle into goal pace, focus on form and breathing  
**Final Third:** This is where your training pays off—trust your fitness

### When It Gets Hard (And It Will)

- **Break the race into smaller chunks:** Focus on the next mile marker
- **Use mantras:** "Strong and smooth," "I've trained for this"
- **Remember why you're here:** Connect with your deeper motivation

The race is just a celebration of all the training you've already done. Trust your preparation and enjoy the experience.
